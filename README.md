# rpi-ap-scanner
Program developed as part of our university thesis on analysing the signal strength of wireless networks.

The program has three main components: The AP Scanner, the Heatmap and least but not least the script which puts the NIC into monitor mode.

A few future features that are going to be added eventually include, but aren't limited to:

* A Dynamic heatmap coordinate function so that cooordinates are automatically placed on the map
* A "Silent Mode" of operation
* And more!
